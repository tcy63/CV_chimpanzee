# CV for Primates

## Detection

### Data Preparation
First, download the images and labels for detection from [dataset for detection](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/F87EB30E935982FC8082B81D88DDE55C) and decompressed it. It is structured according to yolov5's required format.

```bash
cd datasets
tar -zvxf yolo_detection.tar.gz
```

yolov5 assumes that the directory is sturctured as follows:
```
- datasets
    - yolo_detection
        - images
            - train
                - <name>.jpg
                - ...
            - val
        - labels
            - train
                - <name>.txt
                - ...
            - val
- yolov5
```

Second, change the `datasets/chimpanzee.yaml` file according to your needs. You can change the `path` as it is the root dirctory of your dataset. It can be a path relative to the `yaml` file or a absolute path.

**NOTE**: yolov5 will substitute `images` with `labels` automatically to find the corresponding label path. Thus, for your convenience, you'd better not change the directory name.
```yaml
path: ../yolo_detection
train: images/train
val: images/val
test: # optional

names:
  0: chimpanzee
```

### Training
You can train a model from scratch:
```bash
python yolov5/train.py --data datasets/chimpanzee.yaml --weights '' --cfg yolov5s.yaml --img 640
```
Or you can use the pre-trained weights and finetune the whole network:
```bash
python yolov5/train.py --data datasets/chimpanzee.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt --img 640
```
For more details, please refer to the yolov5 GitHub page.

## Identification
### Data Preparation
First, download the dataset from [cropped images for identification](https://disk.pku.edu.cn:443/link/4DE85DF2CC9B6F655615FF26A1D9E853) and decompress it.
Here, 'crop' implies that the images used for identification are groung-truth bounding boxes.

```bash
cd datasets
tar -zvxf crop_identification.tar.gz
```
After decompression, the directory looks like this:
```
- datasets
    - yolo_detection
    - crop_identification
        - train
            - Azibo
                - 0.jpg
                - ...
            - Bambari
            - ...
            - Tai
        - val
```

### Methods
#### 1. Supervised Training with Large Margin Cosine Loss (LMCL)
##### 1) Background
***Large Margin Cosine Loss*** was first proposed by [CosFace: Large Margin Cosine Loss for Deep Face Recognition](https://openaccess.thecvf.com/content_cvpr_2018/papers/Wang_CosFace_Large_Margin_CVPR_2018_paper.pdf). It aims to learn discriminative features by maximizing inter-class cosine margin. Our work first adopt this loss function in chimpanzee recognition and get relatively good results.

During training, the weight feature $W$ is trained together with the backbone model. This loss is formalized as follows:
```math
L_{lmc} = \frac{1}{N}\sum_{i=1}^N -\log \frac{e^{s(\cos(\theta_{y_i},i)-m)}}{e^{s(\cos(\theta_{y_i},i)-m)} + \sum_{j\neq y_i} e^{s(\cos(\theta_{j},i))}} 
```
```math
\cos (\theta_j, i) = W^T_j \cdot x_i \\ W_j = \frac{W^*_j}{||W^*_j||}, x_i = \frac{x^*_i}{||x^*_i||}
```

During testing, the class of largest cosine similarity is the predicted label.
```math
\text{Pred}_i = \text{argmax}_j (W^T_j \cdot x_i)
```
There are two hyperparameters in this loss: the forced margin $m$ and feature norm $s$.

##### 2) Model
During training and testing, the model is sturctured as follows:
```
- encoder: resnet50 -> feat_dim = 2048
- head: mlp -> feat_dim = 128
    - Linear (2048, 2048)
    - ReLu
    - Linear (2048, 128)
- weight: W -> num_classes = 17
    - normalized Linear (128, 17)
```
The model is trained end-to-end and validated on-the-fly.

##### 3) Training

First, change the file `identification/configs/train_lmcl.yaml` according to your needs. 

For example, `load_pt_encoder` indicates whether to use the pre-trained weights of the encoder provided by PyTorch. 

```yaml
# Part of the yaml file as an example
model: lmcl
model_args:
    encoder: resnet50
    head: mlp
    load_pt_encoder: True
```

Then, train the model using the configuration in the `yaml` file.
```
python identification/train.py --config identification/configs/train_lmcl.yaml
```
NOTE: you should be careful with your current working directory and the path set in the `yaml` file.

You will get the output every `print_freq` epochs like this:
```
epoch 20, train time 2.26, train_loss 11.95, train_acc 31.12; val_loss 10.80, val_acc 46.40
epoch 40, train time 2.04, train_loss 10.69, train_acc 38.37; val_loss 11.21, val_acc 43.53
epoch 60, train time 2.02, train_loss 9.71, train_acc 44.11; val_loss 10.35, val_acc 55.76
epoch 80, train time 2.23, train_loss 9.21, train_acc 49.40; val_loss 9.97, val_acc 56.47
epoch 100, train time 2.10, train_loss 9.34, train_acc 49.85; val_loss 11.35, val_acc 55.76
...
```
